We often see things in the world around us rapidly changing. For example the flutter of a butterfly’s wings, or the flicker of a poorly functioning lightbulb. This task explores the speed at which you can make objects flicker in your mind’s eye.

See this flickering lightbulb below. Now close your eyes and try to imagine it going ON and OFF in your mind’s eye. Can you picture it flickering it in your imagery?

Great, then you are good to go.
