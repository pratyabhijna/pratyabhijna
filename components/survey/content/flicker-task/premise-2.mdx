You are about to now see the Flicker Task.

You will see a square box going ON and OFF like the lightbulb we just saw. Under this square will be a slider bar to adjust the flicker rate of the square. Going from SLOW to FAST.

Your task is to FIRST IMAGINE the square as flickering AND THEN ADJUST the slider.

Here you must adjust the slider, such that the flickering square matches the rate at which you can imagine it flickering.

FOLLOW THESE STEPS

1. First close your eyes and imagine a flickering square.
2. Notice how fast you can make the square flicker in your mindâ€™s eye.
3. Match the flickering square on your browser to the speed in which you can imagine it as flickering
4. Take as much time and as many adjustments as needed. Press submit when done.
