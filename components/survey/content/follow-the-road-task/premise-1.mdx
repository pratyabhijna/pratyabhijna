Here, we put another feature of your imagination to test. How long can you continue to imagine something before it breaks.

You will be shown a looping GIF of a scene. Your task is to imagine that scene as continously as possible. In your mind’s eye, take care to make sure that every moment you are picturing exactly what is in the GIF. You must try to do it for as long as possible.

In the main task, you will be shown this GIF. Along with it, you will see 6 options. Each option will show a break point in your imagination. A break point is the duration after which the imagined ROAD breaks in your mind’s eye, and you have to put effort into restarting the image of a flowing road again. Please indicate by choosing the option which break-point is the closest to that of your mind’s eye.
