Once again, we will test how long you can continue to imagine something before it breaks.

You will be shown a GIF of a tap with running water. Your task is to imagine that scene as continuously as possible. In your mind's eye, take care to make sure that every moment you are picturing exactly what is in the GIF. You must try to do it for as long as possible.

In the main task, you will be shown this GIF. Along with it, you will see 6 options. Each option will show a break point in your imagination. A break point is the duration after which the imagined Running Water breaks in your mind's eye, and you have to put effort into restarting the image of water flowing again. Please indicate by choosing the option which break-point is the closest to that of your mind's eye.
