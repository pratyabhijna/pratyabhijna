We often imagine, and practice movements in our heads. We picture how we would look performing a dance move or choreograph steps inside our imagination. Similarly, we can also re-imagine a dance performance. This particular task asks you to do exactly this!

Below, you will see a short clip (~10 seconds) of a few dance steps.

In the main task, you will be asked to close your eyes and imagine these dance steps. Then, you will see a panel of 6 clips depicting the same dance moves. Your task is to pick the movement which best matches how you imagine these dance moves.

Please view the clips as many times as necessary and take as much time as you need to make your decision
