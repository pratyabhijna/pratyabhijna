You are about to begin the Rotation task.

In this task, you will see a cube rotating. You have to picture and imagine this rotating cube in your mind. And then, adjust the speed of the cube in your browser to match how fast you imagined it rotating. Thatâ€™s all.

When you click NEXT, you will see something like this

<div className="wrapper">
  <div className="cube" style={{ animation: `spin 3s infinite linear` }}>
    <div className="one"></div>
    <div className="two"></div>
    <div className="three"></div>
    <div className="four"></div>
    <div className="five"></div>
    <div className="six"></div>
  </div>
</div>

Adjust the speed using the slider, so the cube on the screen rotates just like it does in your mind when you imagine it.
